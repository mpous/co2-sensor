# co2-sensor using Python

This project is for educational purposes. It is based on the Ribbit Network Frog sensor project.

## Requirements

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3/4
* SD card in case of the RPi 3/4
* Power supply and (optionally) ethernet cable

* Adafruit SCD-30 (CO2, temperature and humidity)
* Adafruit Barometer DPS-310
* Sparkfun Qwiic 
* 2 Qwiic 4-pin cables


### Software

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/))
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)

## Deploy the fleet

Find 2 possibilities here:

### One-click deploy using [Balena Deploy](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/)

Running this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application. You can do it in just one click by using the button below:

[![](https://www.balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/mpous/co2-sensor)

Follow instructions, click Add a Device and flash an SD card with that OS image dowloaded from balenaCloud. Enjoy the magic ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

### Deploy via [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/)

If you are a balena CLI expert, feel free to use [balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/). This option lets you configure in detail some options, like adding new services to your deploy or configure de DNS Server to use.

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)
- Create a new fleet on balenaCloud.
- Click `Add a new device` and download the balenaOS image it creates.
- Burn and SD card (if using a Pi), connect it to the device and boot it up.

While the device boots (it will eventually show up in the balenaCloud dashboard) we will prepare de services:

- Clone this repository to your local workstation. Don't forget to update the submodules.
```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/mpous/co2-sensor
cd co2-sensor
```
- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code to the fleet with `balena push <fleet-name>`
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!
